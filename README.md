# CI/CD for Serverless Applications Workshop - X

In this workshop, you will learn how to start a new Serverless application from scratch using the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) and how to fully automate builds and deployments by building a continous delivery pipeline using the AWS CDK. You will also learn how to run a Serverless application locally using the SAM CLI.
